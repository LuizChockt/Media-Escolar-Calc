# School Grade Calculator


This is a simple web-based school grade calculator project that I created as part of my first-semester coursework for the **Analysis and Systems Development** program. It's designed to help me learn programming in JavaScript (JS) and HTML. While the project is currently basic, I plan to continuously improve it as I advance in my studies.
